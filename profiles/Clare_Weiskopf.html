      <h4><em>Alis</em></h4>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Movie Info: </strong>In a shelter for teenage girls in Bogotá, Colombia, directors Clare Weiskopf and Nicolás
            Van Hemelryck ask a group of young women to imagine a fictional classmate named Alis.

         <li><strong>Based on: </strong>Alis is a film that has at its center an experimental approach, a playful collaboratory
            methodology and a metanarrative. Rather than being character-driven, the directors

         <li><strong>Released Year: </strong>2022</li>
         <li><strong>Genre:</strong>

            Egg pictures, among others<br><a href="">Source</a></li>
         <li><strong>Challenges: </strong>Filmmakers describe multiple challenges they faced while conceiving the movie, specially

         <li><strong>Film Technique: </strong><br>
            The filmmakers interviewed one by one each of the girls participating in the project.
            They asked them to imagine Alis and describe her. They had a support group of specialist
            including psychologist experts on trauma. After the interviews the group will get
            together and debrief. The filmmakers held a private screening with the girls once
            the film was done. The girls received the film positively

         <li><strong>Concept Development: </strong><br>The idea of making a film with the girls from Arcadia started when directors Clare
            Weiskopf and Nicolás Van Hemelryck were invited to give workshops on documentary filmmaking
            at the shelter. They soon realized the creative potential of this group of young women
            and decided to begin a process to tell their stories. At the beginning they considered
            a character-driven story but soon realized this approach would not be suficient to
            portray all of the girls and their lifestories. Then, they did an exercise with the
            girls asking them to create a fictional character and through their narrative and
            imaginative process the filmmakers realized they could create a documentary about
            their characters centering an ethical yet very intimate story<br><a href="">Source</a></li>
