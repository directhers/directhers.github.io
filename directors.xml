      <concept_development>The idea of making a film with the girls from Arcadia started when directors Clare Weiskopf and Nicolás Van Hemelryck were invited to give workshops on documentary filmmaking at the shelter. They soon realized the creative potential of this group of young women and decided to begin a process to tell their stories. At the beginning they considered a character-driven story but soon realized this approach would not be suficient to portray all of the girls and their lifestories. Then, they did an exercise with the girls asking them to create a fictional character and through their narrative and imaginative process the filmmakers realized they could create a documentary about their characters centering an ethical yet very intimate story</concept_development>
